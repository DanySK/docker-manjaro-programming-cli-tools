# Manjaro Linux with programming tools

Docker image stuffed with several CLI tools useful for programming.
This project is meant to work around the issues with Windows at my university,
apparently a native linux installation is impossible,
WSL does not work for multi-user,
and technicians could not set up all the tools I need.

So I needed to do this myself, and this is (part of) the result.
